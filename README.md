PROJECT: "ODIN RECIPES"

// INTRODUCTION //
This project involves building a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The purpose of this project is to build my HTML skills that I have learnt so far throughout taking 'The Odin Project: Foundations' course. 
Therefore the website will not look very pretty by the time I am finshed however, I will be revisiting this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

// SKILLS //
- Building a basic website structure using HTML boilerplate
- Using correct HTML elements and tags
- Incorporating texts, styles and paragraphs appropriately  according to their context and importance
- Writing comments throughout code
- Using absolute and relative links
- Implementing images in webpages
- Creating lists (ordered and unordered)
- Organising files into appropriate directories
- Making commits and writing commit messages

// END-OF-PROJECT SELF-REFLECTION //
Overall I really enjoyed this project and finished it a lot faster than I thought I would! I felt very comfortable when working with all the HTML syntax and was able to execute my code smoothly without encountering any issues. I was also able to implement all the required components as listed in the 'Assignment' details of the course. The repetitiveness of the tasks really helped in increasing my confidence in both working with the terminal and coding in HTML. I also felt that my understanding and regular use of the terminal helped in building my understanding of how the basic website structure works, in terms of the organisation of files into directories. Throughout this project, I found writing the commit messages to be the most difficult task, since I would frequently forget to save before making a commit, therefore somewhat creating a dpulicate commit. In my next projects, I aim to work on improving the quality of of commit messages by ensuring that I save the file before making a commit, and also sticking to particular way of wordings (e.g., If I were to write "Add details to 'Description'" then for another commit I would write "Edit wording in 'Ingredients' instead of "Edit wording in ingredients" - the point is the way I have referenced the headings with single quotation marks). I also aim to work on commenting throughout my code throughout writing the code instead of leaving all commenting at the very end (it felt quite tedious to copy similar comments back and forth from one file to another). Next time, I plan to comment throughout the code for one file as I am working on it, so then when I create a copy of that file to make a separate file of the same format, the comments are already in there and I can just edit them accordingly to match the separate file I'm working on.
