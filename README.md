PROJECT: "ODIN RECIPES"

// INTRODUCTION //
This project involves building a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The purpose of this project is to build my HTML skills that I have learnt so far throughout taking the The Odin Project: Foundations course. 
Therefore the website will not look very pretty by the time I am finshed however, I will be revisiting this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

// SKILLS //
- Building a basic website structure using HTML boilerplate
- Using correct HTML elements and tags
- Incorporating texts, styles and paragraphs appropriately  according to their context and importance
- Writing comments throughout code
- Using absolute and relative links
- Implementing images in webpages
- Creating lists (ordered and unordered)
- Organising files into appropriate directories
- Making commits and writing commit messages
