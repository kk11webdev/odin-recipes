    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This carrot cake recipe is moist, light, fluffy, and topped with a rich cream cheese frosting. It's been a family-favourite for many years, all claiming that it's been by far the best carrot cake they've ever had. The best part about this recipe is that you can tweak it to match your preferences - for instance, if you're like me and want your carrot cake to taste more spicy and autumn-y, go for that extra cinnamon!</p> 
        
    <p>The ingredients you'll need to make your new go-to carrot cake include sugar (white or brown), any neutral oil (such as vegetable oil), eggs, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, baking soda and baking powder, ground cinnamon, salt, and most importantly carrots! You'll also need butter, cream cheese and confectioners' sugar to whip up a light and fluffy cream cheese frosting to spread onto the cake. Top it off with some chopped pecans and you're done!
