    <h2>Description</h2>

    <div class="desc">
        <p>This carrot cake recipe is moist, light, fluffy, and topped with a rich cream cheese frosting. It's been a family-favourite for years, with many praising that it's by far the best carrot cake they've ever had! You can store the frosted cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.</p> 

        <p>The ingredients you'll need to make your new go-to carrot cake include sugar (white or brown), any neutral oil (such as vegetable oil), eggs, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, baking soda and baking powder, ground cinnamon, salt, and most importantly carrots! You'll also need butter, cream cheese and confectioners' sugar to whip up a light and fluffy cream cheese frosting to spread onto the cake. Add some chopped pecans if you're looking to give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch. </p>
